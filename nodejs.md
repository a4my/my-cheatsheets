# Fundamentals of NodeJs

## basic commands in their terminal

```
    node -v // returns the version of node installed on your computer
    node // enters JS mode in the terminal
    ctr+D // will stop the JS mode
    node script.js // will read the JS script

    3*8 = 24
    _+ 6 = 30
    the underscore represents the previous sum


```

## Read & Write files in NodeJS

â€¢ create a JS file and use the commands of the FS package:

```js
const fs = require("fs")

const textIn = fs.readFileSync("./txt/input.txt", "utf-8") // To read the input.txt file
console.log(textIn)

const textOut = `This is what we know about the avocado: ${textIn}. \n Created on ${Date.now()}`
fs.writeFileSync("./txt/output.txt", textOut) // To write/create a file called output.txt
console.log("File written")
```

â€¢ To activate the script, you must call the following command in the terminal:

`node index.js`

## Read & Write files asynchronously

â€¢ Use the asynchronous properties of FS:

```js
fs.readFile("./txt/start.txt", "utf-8", (err, data1) => {
  fs.readFile(`./txt/${data1}.txt`, "utf-8", (err, data2) => {
    console.log(data2)
    fs.readFile(`./txt/append.txt`, "utf-8", (err, data3) => {
      console.log(data3)

      fs.writeFile("./txt/final.txt", `${data2}\n${data3}`, "utf-8", err => {
        console.log("Your file has been written ðŸ˜Ž")
      })
    })
  })
})
console.log("Will read file!")
```

âœ”ðŸ˜‰ Note that the synchronous properties of FS were called `readFileSync` and `writeFileSync` and that the asynchronous ones were called `readFile` and `writeFile`.
