## What's Angular

Angular is an SPA (Single Pae Application) created in 2010 and maintained by Google. Angular is a Component Based Frontend Framework (like React and Vue.js)

Angular.js is the first version and Angular now refers to the version 2 and above.

It is an all-in-one solution (routing, http, etc) but mainly used for big applications. It uses TypeScript and ES6 and has a great CLI.

Angular uses concepts such as MVC, "modules", "services" or "observables" and ngrx for state management (equivalent of Redux in React).

## Angular npm config

`npm install -g @angular/cli` will generate an Angular app whenever and wherever on your computer
`ng --version` will show details about the Angular version installed on your computer.
`ng new appname` will create an Angular app called "appname"
`ng serve` will run the live server
`ng generate component components/Todos` will create a new component in a folder called Todos inside a folder called component
