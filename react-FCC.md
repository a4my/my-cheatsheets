# Basics of React

### JSX

React is an Open Source view library created and maintained by Facebook. It's a great tool to render the User Interface (UI) of modern web applications.

React uses a syntax extension of JavaScript called JSX that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript. However, because JSX is not valid JavaScript, JSX code must be compiled into JavaScript. The transpiler Babel is a popular tool for this process.

❗ One important thing to know about nested JSX is that it must return a single element.

```js
ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))

const JSX = (
  <div>
    <p>Paragraph One</p>
    <p>Paragraph Two</p>
    <p>Paragraph Three</p>
  </div>
)
```

### Comments in JSX

To put comments inside JSX, you use the syntax {/\* \*/} to wrap around the comment text.

```js
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    {/* This is my comment*/}
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
)
```

### Render HTML Elements to the DOM

ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this:

```js
ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode)
```

As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations, just like how you must declare variables before using them.

```js
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
)

const challengeNode = document.getElementById('challenge-node')
ReactDOM.render(JSX, challengeNode)
```

### Define an HTML Class in JSX

One key difference in JSX is that you can no longer use the word `class` to define HTML classes. This is because class is a reserved word in JavaScript. Instead, JSX uses `className`.

In fact, the naming convention for all HTML attributes and event references in JSX become camelCase. For example, a click event in JSX is `onClick`, instead of `onclick`. Likewise, `onchange` becomes `onChange`. While this is a subtle difference, it is an important one to keep in mind moving forward.

```js
const JSX = (
  <div className="my-div">
    <h1>Add a class to this div</h1>
  </div>
)
```

### Self-closing tags

In JSX, the rules are a little different. Any JSX element can be written with a self-closing tag, and every element must be closed.

The line-break tag, for example, must always be written as <br /> in order to be valid JSX that can be transpiled. A `<div>`, on the other hand, can be written as `<div />` or `<div></div>`. The difference is that in the first syntax version there is no way to include anything in the `<div />`.

# React components

### Create a Stateless Functional Component

There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component. There are two ways to create a React component. The first way is to use a JavaScript function. Defining a component in this way creates a stateless functional component.

To create a component with a function, you simply write a JavaScript function that returns either JSX or null.

❗ One important thing to note is that React requires your function name to begin with a capital letter.

```js
const DemoComponent = function () {
  return <div className="customClass" />
}
```

Because a JSX component represents HTML, you could put several components together to create a more complex HTML page. This is one of the key advantages of the component architecture React provides. It allows you to compose your UI from many separate, isolated components. This makes it easier to build and maintain complex user interfaces.

### Create a React Component

The other way to define a React component is with the ES6 class syntax. In the following example, Kitten extends React.Component:

```js
class Kitten extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hi</h1>
  }
}
```

This creates an ES6 class Kitten which extends the React.Component class. So the Kitten class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks.

Notice the Kitten class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of objects that are created with the class keyword.

It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. This makes sure the component is initialized properly.

### Create a Component with Composition

Now we will look at how we can compose multiple React components together. Imagine you are building an app and have created three components: a Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

To compose these components together, you could create an App parent component which renders each of these three components as children. To render a component as a child in a React component, you include the component name written as a custom HTML tag in the JSX. For example, in the render method you could write:

```js
return (
  <App>
    <Navbar />
    <Dashboard />
    <Footer />
  </App>
)
```

When React encounters a custom HTML tag that references another component (a component name wrapped in < /> like in this example), it renders the markup for that component in the location of the tag. This should illustrate the parent/child relationship between the App component and the Navbar, Dashboard, and Footer.

```js
const ChildComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>I am the child</p>
    </div>
  )
}

class ParentComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>I am the parent</h1>
        <ChildComponent />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Use React to Render Nested Components

There are many other different ways you can compose components with React.

Component composition is one of React's powerful features. When you work with React, it is important to start thinking about your user interface in terms of components like the App example in above. You break down your UI into its basic building blocks, and those pieces become the components. This helps to separate the code responsible for the UI from the code responsible for handling your application logic. It can greatly simplify the development and maintenance of complex projects.

```js
const TypesOfFruit = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Fruits:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Blueberries</li>
        <li>Strawberries</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

const Fruits = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <TypesOfFruit />
    </div>
  )
}

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        <Fruits />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Compose React components

Rendering ES6 style class components within other components is no different than rendering the simple components you used above. You can render JSX elements, stateless functional components, and ES6 class components within other components.

```js
class Fruits extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Fruits:</h2>
        <NonCitrus />
        <Citrus />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        <Fruits />
        <Vegetables />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Render a Class Component to the DOM

React components are passed into `ReactDOM.render()` a little differently than JSX elements. For JSX elements, you pass in the name of the element that you want to render. However, for React components, you need to use the same syntax as if you were rendering a nested component, for example `ReactDOM.render(<ComponentToRender />, targetNode)`. You use this syntax for both ES6 class components and functional components.

```js
class TypesOfFood extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Types of Food:</h1>
        <Fruits />
        <Vegetables />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

const targetNode = document.getElementById('challenge-node')
ReactDOM.render(<TypesOfFood />, targetNode)
```

# Props

### Pass Props to a Stateless Functional Component

In React, you can pass `props`, or properties, to child components. Say you have an App component which renders a child component called Welcome which is a stateless functional component. You can pass `Welcome` a `user` property by writing:

```js
<App>
  <Welcome user="Mark" />
</App>
```

You use `custom HTML attributes` created by you and supported by React to be passed to the component. In this case, the created property user is passed to the component Welcome. Since Welcome is a stateless functional component, it has access to this value like so:

```js
const Welcome = props => <h1>Hello, {props.user}!</h1>
```

It is standard to call this value props and when dealing with stateless functional components, you basically consider it as an argument to a function which returns JSX. You can access the value of the argument in the function body. With class components, you will see this is a little different.

```js
const CurrentDate = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>The current date is: {props.date}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

class Calendar extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>What date is it?</h3>
        <CurrentDate date={Date()} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Pass an Array as Props

To pass an array to a JSX element, it must be treated as JavaScript and wrapped in curly braces.

```js
<ParentComponent>
  <ChildComponent colors={['green', 'blue', 'red']} />
</ParentComponent>
```

The child component then has access to the array property colors. Array methods such as `join()` can be used when accessing the property. `const ChildComponent = (props) => <p>{props.colors.join(', ')}</p>` This will join all colors array items into a comma separated string and produce: `<p>green, blue, red</p>`

```js
const List = props => {
  return <p>{props.tasks.join(', ')}</p>
}

class ToDo extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>To Do Lists</h1>
        <h2>Today</h2>
        <List tasks={['walk dog', 'workout']} />
        <h2>Tomorrow</h2>
        <List tasks={['walk dog', 'workout', 'eat']} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Use Default Props

React also has an option to set default props. You can assign default props to a component as a property on the component itself and React assigns the default prop if necessary. This allows you to specify what a prop value should be if no value is explicitly provided. For example, if you declare `MyComponent.defaultProps = { location: 'San Francisco' }`, you have defined a location prop that's set to the string `San Francisco`, unless you specify otherwise. React assigns default props if props are undefined, but if you pass `null` as the value for a prop, it will remain `null`.

```js
const ShoppingCart = props => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Shopping Cart Component</h1>
    </div>
  )s
}
// Change code below this line

ShoppingCart.defaultProps = { items: 0 }
```

### Override Default Props

The ability to set default props is a useful feature in React. The way to override the default props is to explicitly set the prop values for a component.

```js
const Items = props => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
}

Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
}

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return <Items quantity={100} />
  }
}
```

### Use PropTypes to Define the Props You Expect

React provides useful type-checking features to verify that components receive props of the correct type. For example, your application makes an API call to retrieve data that you expect to be in an array, which is then passed to a component as a prop. You can set propTypes on your component to require the data to be of type array. This will throw a useful warning when the data is of any other type.

It's considered a best practice to set propTypes when you know the type of a prop ahead of time. You can define a propTypes property for a component in the same way you defined defaultProps. Doing this will check that props of a given key are present with a given type. Here's an example to require the type function for a prop called handleClick:

```js
MyComponent.propTypes = { handleClick: PropTypes.func.isRequired }
```

In the example above, the PropTypes.func part checks that handleClick is a function. Adding isRequired tells React that handleClick is a required property for that component. You will see a warning if that prop isn't provided. Also notice that func represents function. Among the seven JavaScript primitive types, function and boolean (written as bool) are the only two that use unusual spelling. In addition to the primitive types, there are other types available. For example, you can check that a prop is a React element.

❗ As of React v15.5.0, PropTypes is imported independently from React, like this: import PropTypes from 'prop-types'.

```js
const Items = props => {
  return <h1>Current Quantity of Items in Cart: {props.quantity}</h1>
}

Items.propTypes = { quantity: PropTypes.number.isRequired }

Items.defaultProps = {
  quantity: 0
}

class ShoppingCart extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return <Items />
  }
}
```

### Access Props Using this.props

The above covered the basic ways to pass props to child components. But what if the child component that you're passing a prop to is an ES6 class component, rather than a stateless functional component? The ES6 class component uses a slightly different convention to access props.

Anytime you refer to a class component within itself, you use the this keyword. To access props within a class component, you preface the code that you use to access it with this. For example, if an ES6 class component has a prop called data, you write {this.props.data} in JSX.

```js
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Welcome name="Mark" />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>
          Hello, <strong>{this.props.name}</strong>!
        </p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

# State

### Create a Stateful Component

One of the most important topics in React is state. State consists of any data your application needs to know about, that can change over time. You want your apps to respond to state changes and present an updated UI when necessary. React offers a nice solution for the state management of modern web applications.

You create state in a React component by declaring a state property on the component class in its constructor. This initializes the component with state when it is created. The state property must be set to a JavaScript object. Declaring it looks like this:

```js
this.state = {}
```

You have access to the state object throughout the life of your component. You can update it, render it in your UI, and pass it as props to child components. The state object can be as complex or as simple as you need it to be. Note that you must create a class component by extending React.Component in order to create state like this.

```js
class StatefulComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'Alex'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Render State in the User Interface

Once you define a component's initial state, you can display any part of it in the UI that is rendered. If a component is stateful, it will always have access to the data in state in its render() method. You can access the data with this.state.

If you want to access a state value within the return of the render method, you have to enclose the value in curly braces.

state is one of the most powerful features of components in React. It allows you to track important data in your app and render a UI in response to changes in this data. If your data changes, your UI will change. React uses what is called a virtual DOM, to keep track of changes behind the scenes. When state data updates, it triggers a re-render of the components using that data - including child components that received the data as a prop. React updates the actual DOM, but only where necessary. This means you don't have to worry about changing the DOM. You simply declare what the UI should look like.

Note that if you make a component stateful, no other components are aware of its state. Its state is completely encapsulated, or local to that component, unless you pass state data to a child component as props. This notion of encapsulated state is very important because it allows you to write certain logic, then have that logic contained and isolated in one place in your code.

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'React is awesome'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Render State in the User Interface Another Way

There is another way to access state in a component. In the render() method, before the return statement, you can write JavaScript directly. For example, you could declare functions, access data from state or props, perform computations on this data, and so on. Then, you can assign any data to variables, which you have access to in the return statement.

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'freeCodeCamp'
    }
  }
  render() {
    const name = this.state.name
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{name}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

# State

The above covered component `state` and how to initialize `state` in the constructor. There is also a way to change the component's `state`. React provides a method for updating component state called `setState`. You call the setState method within your component class like so: `this.setState()`, passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data. For instance, if we were storing a `username` in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:

```js
this.setState({
  username: 'Lewis'
})
```

React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur. Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance. What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous. There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem. This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind!

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    }
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState({
      name: 'React Rocks!'
    })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

### Bind 'this' to a Class Method

In addition to setting and updating `state`, you can also define methods for your component class. A class method typically needs to use the `this` keyword so it can access properties on the class (such as `state` and `props`) inside the scope of the method. There are a few ways to allow your class methods to access `this`.

One common way is to explicitly bind `this` in the constructor so `this` becomes bound to the class methods when the component is initialized. You may have noticed the last challenge used `this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)` for its `handleClick` method in the constructor. Then, when you call a function like `this.setState()` within your class method, `this` refers to the class and will not be `undefined`.

### Use State to Toggle an Element

Sometimes you might need to know the previous state when updating the state. However, state updates may be asynchronous - this means React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update. This means you can't rely on the previous value of `this.state` or `this.props` when calculating the next value. So, you should not use code like this:

```js
// ❌⛔🚫⭕
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment
})
```

Instead, you should pass setState a function that allows you to access state and props. Using a function with setState guarantees you are working with the most current values of state and props. This means that the above should be rewritten as:

```js
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}))
```

You can also use a form without props if you need only the state:

```js
this.setState(state => ({
  counter: state.counter + 1
}))
```

❕ Note that you have to wrap the object literal in parentheses, otherwise JavaScript thinks it's a block of code.

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      visibility: false
    }
    this.toggleVisibility = this.toggleVisibility.bind(this)
  }
  toggleVisibility() {
    this.setState(state => {
      if (state.visibility === true) {
        return { visibility: false }
      } else {
        return { visibility: true }
      }
    })
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.visibility) {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
          <h1>Now you see me!</h1>
        </div>
      )
    } else {
      return (
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleVisibility}>Click Me</button>
        </div>
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### Write a Simple Counter

You can design a more complex stateful component by combining the concepts covered so far. These include initializing state, writing methods that set state, and assigning click handlers to trigger these methods.

```js
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    }
    this.increment = this.increment.bind(this)
    this.decrement = this.decrement.bind(this)
    this.reset = this.reset.bind(this)
  }
  increment() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      count: state.count + 1
    }))
  }
  decrement() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      count: state.count - 1
    }))
  }
  reset() {
    this.setState({
      count: 0
    })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button className="inc" onClick={this.increment}>
          Increment!
        </button>
        <button className="dec" onClick={this.decrement}>
          Decrement!
        </button>
        <button className="reset" onClick={this.reset}>
          Reset
        </button>
        <h1>Current Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
