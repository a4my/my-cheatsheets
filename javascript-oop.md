# What is OOP?

Classes are like blueprint from which we can create new objects.

We call all objects created through a class instances.

The 4 fundamental principles of OOP: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism

## Abstraction

--> Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview.

## Encapsulation

--> Keeping properties and methods private inside the class so they are not accessible from outside the class

## Inheritance

--> Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, forming a hierarchical between classes. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real world relationships.

## Polymorphism

--> A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class.
